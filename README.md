# RTPA - Ready Tailwind CSS Project Assistant Creation Tool

RTPA (Rapid Tailwind Project Assistant) is a command-line tool designed to simplify the creation of new web projects with **Tailwind CSS**. It supports setting up both simple HTML/CSS projects and modern **Vite.js** based projects, with automatic Tailwind CSS integration.

## Features

* **Fast Project Creation:** Launch a new static HTML/CSS project or a Vite.js project in seconds.

* **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Automatically configures Tailwind CSS for your project.

* **Vite.js Option:** Sets up Vite.js with the Tailwind CSS plugin for a modern development experience.

* **Command Line Arguments:** Specify project type and name directly from the command line.

* **Git Initialization:** Automatically initializes a local Git repository.

* **GitHub Integration (Optional):** Initializes a GitHub repository and pushes your code (requires a GitHub PAT).

## Installation

To use RTPA, you need Node.js and npm (or Yarn/pnpm) installed on your machine.

### Global Installation (Recommended)

Using npm : you can install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g rtpa
```
```bash
yarn global add rtpa
```
```bash
pnpm install -g rtpa
```

## Usage
You can use RTPA in several ways:

1. **interactive mode**
Run the command without any arguments to choose the project type and name via interactive prompts:

- for simple HTML/CSS project
```bash
rtpa
```

- for vite vanilla js project 
```bash
rtpavite
```

2. **Direct project creation**
Use the `--js` flags to directly specify the project type. You can also provide the project name immediately after the flag.

- Create a vite project:

```bash
rtpavite --js project-name
```

if `project-name` is omitted, the tool will prompt you for it.
Exemple `rtpavite --js my-vite-app`


## Github Configuration

When prompted by the tool, you can choose to link your project to a new GitHub repository. You will need to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with repo permission for the tool to create and push the repository on your behalf.

### How to get your personnal token (PAT) ? :

- clic here [personal token settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

- clic on "Generate new token".

- Choose token(classic)

- give an explicit name to the token (`ex: cli-tailwind-tool`).

- give `repo` permission by checking the repo option.

- Clic on "Generate token" and copy and paste your token somewhere accessible because you'll not see it again (save it wisely in a personal file).


## Quick Start After Creation
Once your project is created, follow the instructions displayed in your terminal.

### For a Simple HTML/CSS Project:
1. Navigate to your project folder: cd [project-name]
2. Launch the Tailwind CSS compiler in watch mode: npm run start
3. Open your index.html file in a web browser to see your live changes.

### For a Vite.js Project:
1. Navigate to your project folder: cd [project-name]
2. Launch the Vite development server: npm run dev
3. Open your browser to the local address indicated by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173/).

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.


## Note : 

your token is not saved in the code or send somewhere, in order to keep your github account secure.
